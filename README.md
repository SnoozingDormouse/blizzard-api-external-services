# blizzard-api-external-services
stand-alone microservice that pulls meta-data from the blizzard api

This micro-service is intended to work in conjuction with the WoWTimeOptimisation project - therefore it shares a database project
with that project.  However it is perfectly fine to use it stand-alone.

The database project is called BlizzardNonCharacterData

The service should stand-alone and be able to pull slowly-changing meta-data about the World of Warcraft game from the Blizzard API
